# C-and-C++ Projects

The VIMSIM program, known as “VIM_SIM CODE Basic Versio.cpp” for the CPP file in this directory, known as “Vim_SIm.c” in the advanced version directory of this one, is a program I designed for fun to simulate the infamously known VIM text editor in the terminal nobody knows how to close haha. You can do all sorts of things via the terminal: read, write, delete files, etc etc. I wrote a manual mode for it to so you’ll have an idea of what to do. Oh, and unlike VIM, this one is easier to close.
